# CS50W - Google Search

**Objective**: Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search

## Specifications

The project must meet the following *requirements*:

### **Pages**: 

* Your website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
* On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

### **Query Text**: 

* On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click __“Google Search”__, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
* Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.

### **Query Images**: 
* On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

### **Query Advanced**:  
* On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
* Find pages with… __“all these words:”__
* Find pages with… __“this exact word or phrase:”__
* Find pages with… __“any of these words:”__
* Find pages with… __“none of these words:”__

### **Appearance**: 
* Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
* Any __<input>__ element (whether its type is text, submit, number, or something else entirely) can have name and value attributes that will become GET parameters when a form is submitted.
* You may also find it helpful to look at Google’s own HTML to answer these questions. In most browsers, you can control-click or right-click on a page and choose __“View Page Source”__ to view the page’s underlying HTML.
* To include an input field in a form that users cannot see or modify, you can use a __“hidden”__ input field.
